#Imagine working on software that processes text. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
#
# Create a Ruby method that determines if a string is a palindrome. This method should take in one string as a parameter. This method should return true if the string is a palindrome.

#input = "racecar"
# output => true
#
# input = "kayak"
# true
#
# input = "Hello, World!"
# output => false

#length = string.length
# i = 0
#
# while i < (length/2)
#     if string[i] != string[length - i - 1]
#         return false
#     end
#     i+=1
#  end
# return true
